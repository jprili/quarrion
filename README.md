A small interpreted programming language.
This is my first attempt making my own programming language
so there's probably no practical application for this one.

## premise
So, when I was learning computer architecture,
I found the assembly syntax pretty neat;
writing programs for ARM chips made me think
"Wow, this is actually simpler than I thought,"
which is why I want to make my own
language that's inspired by it.

A few months later, I wanted to learn
OCaml for my functional programming class
and I was impressed by the simplicity and 
the robustness of not only the language, 
but Lambda calculus itself.

## keywords
Like some assembly keywords,
there will be `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, and so on.
Though, I'm sure there will be *a lot* of differences.
Currently, I'm thinking boolean and extended
math operations to abstract things.
