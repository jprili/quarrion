# Quarrion

This document serves as the language definition for
Quarrion.

## What is Quarrion?
Quarrion is another word for a cockatiel,
I have one as a pet, her name is Tofu, and this language
is named after her species of parrot.

This language is interpreted and functional.
Inspired by assembly syntax and Lambda calculus,
this language is a mix of both of them,
but it is NOT assembly.
